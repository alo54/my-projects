# Analyzing Alarmist Language in News Headlines and COVID-19 Spread

This project explores whether the frequency of alarmist words in local news headlines during the early COVID-19 pandemic correlates with the number of COVID-19 cases per capita across different Mexican states.

The goal is to determine if sensational or alarm-heavy language had a measurable relationship with public health outcomes — specifically the spread of COVID-19.


## Description

The project performs a statistical analysis combining:

- The frequency of predefined alarmist words in COVID-related news headlines across 10 Mexican states.

The corresponding number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people during a selected window (e.g., March–April 2020).
