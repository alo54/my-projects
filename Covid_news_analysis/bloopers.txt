An R² score of -3733.217 is extremely bad.

What does it mean?
The R² score is a measure of how well your model predicts compared to a simple baseline model (predicting the mean of the target variable for all instances).

A negative R² means your model performs worse than predicting the average for all observations.

An R² of -3733.217 means your model is massively overestimating or underestimating, leading to huge errors, and the residual sum of squares is thousands of times worse than the variance of the actual data.

Possible reasons:
Feature scaling issues (some models like DecisionTree or LinearRegression can behave strangely if the data is improperly scaled or contains extreme values).

Wrong features: The features might have no real predictive power or the relationship might not be linear.

Data leakage or incorrect target column.

Highly skewed data or outliers causing the model to perform poorly.

How to debug it:
✅ Check if the target variable and features are correctly defined.
✅ Plot your predictions vs actual values to see what's happening.
✅ Check for extreme outliers or incorrect data entries.
✅ Check your features correlation with the target. If no relationship exists, the model can't guess correctly.
✅ Try simpler baselines (like always predicting the mean) and compare.

Would you like a code snippet to automatically detect why the model is so bad (like error distribution, outliers, or feature-target correlation)? If yes, just say "Yes, debug code."
